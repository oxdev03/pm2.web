1. [Setup Backend](./apps/backend/README.md)
2. Setup Dashboard
   - **A:** [Setup Dashboard On Premise](./apps/dashboard/README.md#on-premise)

## Usage

Once pm2.web is installed and running, you can perform the following actions:

- **Monitoring**:

  - Monitor the status, resource usage, and health of your processes from the main dashboard.

- **Process**:

  - Stop, restart, or delete processes from the process list page.
  - Access the logs generated by your processes.
  - View key metrics, git versioning info and graphs to assess the performance of your applications.
  - Pm2 Settings & Git Feature

- **Server Management (Planned/On Demand)**:

  - Control server-level functions such as shutdown or restart using the dedicated server management page.
  - Execute these actions securely without the need for direct server access.
  - View key metrics and graphs
  - Configure specific server settings (db log rotation , polling/update interval)

- **Access Control**:

  - Manage user access and permissions through the access control settings.
  - Create user accounts, assign roles, and specify the level of access each user has to servers, processes, and application functions.

- **Settings**:

  - Configure settings such as the update interval, log rotation, and more.

- **Alert Setup (Planned/On Demand)**:

  - Configure alerts to receive notifications for specific actions.
  - Define alert rules based on events like shutdown, restart, or kill actions.

- **User Registration**:
  - User can register at the `/login` page
  - If a registration code is configured, the user needs to enter the code
  - The 1st user which registers is automatically assigned the owner permission
  - The owner can assign permissions to registered users through the access control page
  - registered user without any permissions can't access the dashboard nor login
  - accounts linked with oauth2 can't login with credentials (can be unlinked in the settings page)
    - **Setup Github OAuth**
      - https://github.com/settings/developers -> New OAuth App
      - Configure the callback url to `http://<domain|ip:port>/api/auth/callback/github`
      - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_GITHUB_SECRET` to the `.env` file with the values from the OAuth App
      - **Usage**: Only registered users (per credentials) can login with auth2, which links the oauth2 with the existing user account in the database
    - **Setup Registration Code**
      - Go to the settings page and add/generate the registration code
    - **Setup Google OAuth (Planned/On Demand)**
      - TBD
