With pm2.web, you can easily monitor your processes, control them with various actions, view logs, manage server functions, and even set up access controls for users.Easily install, deploy to Vercel, and utilize MongoDB Atlas to maintain a server with 0 open ports or host everything on-premise.

## Installation

To get started with pm2.web, follow these steps:

1. [Setup Backend](./apps/backend/README.md)
2. Setup Dashboard
   - **A:** [Setup Dashboard On Premise](./apps/dashboard/README.md#on-premise)
   - **B:** [Setup Dashboard Vercel](./apps/dashboard/README.md#vercel--mongodb-atlas)

## Usage

Once pm2.web is installed and running, you can perform the following actions:

- **Monitoring**:

  - Monitor the status, resource usage, and health of your processes from the main dashboard.

- **Process**:

  - Stop, restart, or delete processes from the process list page.
  - Access the logs generated by your processes.
  - View key metrics and graphs to assess the performance of your applications.
  - Pm2 Settings & Git Feature

- **Server Management (Planned)**:

  - Control server-level functions such as shutdown or restart using the dedicated server management page.
  - Execute these actions securely without the need for direct server access.
  - View key metrics and graphs
  - Configure specific server settings (db log rotation , polling/update interval)

- **Access Control**:

  - Manage user access and permissions through the access control settings.
  - Create user accounts, assign roles, and specify the level of access each user has to servers, processes, and application functions.

- **Settings**:

  - Configure settings such as the update interval, log rotation, and more.

- **Alert Setup (Planned)**:

  - Configure alerts to receive notifications for specific actions.
  - Define alert rules based on events like shutdown, restart, or kill actions.

- **User Registration**:
  - User can register at the `/login` page
  - If a registration code is configured, the user needs to enter the code
  - The 1st user which registers is automatically assigned the owner permission
  - The owner can assign permissions to registered users through the access control page
  - registered user without any permissions can't access the dashboard nor login
  - accounts linked with oauth2 can't login with credentials (can be unlinked in the settings page)
    - **Setup Github OAuth**
      - https://github.com/settings/developers -> New OAuth App
      - Configure the callback url to `http://<domain|ip:port>/api/auth/callback/github`
      - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_GITHUB_SECRET` to the `.env` file with the values from the OAuth App
      - **Usage**: Only registered users (per credentials) can login with auth2, which links the oauth2 with the existing user account in the database
    - **Setup Registration Code**
      - Go to the settings page and add/generate the registration code
    - **Setup Google OAuth**
      - TBD
